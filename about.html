    <h3><i>Everyday, tonnes of food in urban cities is thrown away because they could not be consumed before expiry.
            Food wastage not only has a big impact on the environment, but also could have been better used to feed
            communities in need.
            Through the food distribution activities, our major goal is eradicating hunger across our country. To reach
            our goals in serving to poor communities, we need the support from each one in the society in their best
            possible ways as it is very essential and such noble tasks can be executed well together.Through this
            project we aim to save the lives of malnourished communities across our country.CARF has been hosting
            various food distribution programmes across the Mumbai region at different locations, with a sole aim to
            empower vulnerable communities to improve their access to food and hunger eradication. We understand that
            hunger and undernutrition are often linked to extreme poverty and lack of access to available, sufficient,
            nutritious food. Our sole initiatives behind organizing such humanitarian projects are to support the
            underprivileged population to live a healthy life. </i>

        A number of factors contribute to food waste in urban areas, including:</div2>

    <ul>
        <li> Poor planning and purchasing habits: Consumers often buy more food than they need, leading to spoilage.
        </li>
        <li>Storage issues: Improper storage of food can lead to spoilage, even if the food was initially fresh.</li>
        <li>Confusing food labels: "Best before" and "use by" dates can be confusing, leading consumers to discard food
            that is still edible.</li>
        <li>Portion sizes: Restaurant meals are often much larger than what people can eat in one sitting, leading to
            leftovers that are often thrown away.</li>
